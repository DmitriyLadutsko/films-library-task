- adding/updating a director
- adding/updating a film

#### The following technologies were used for the development:
- JDK 11

- Spring Boot 2.4.2 (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, Flyway Migration, Lombok)
- PosgreSQL 10.15 DB

**_Before building and running the app:_**

- Clone the repository with the app by following [link](https://github.com/DmitriyLadutsko/films-library-task.git) to the local directory or download the ZIP archive from the same link
- Ð¡reate a new database and a new user in PostgreSQL from psql console:
 ```
   CREATE DATABASE movies;
   CREATE USER director WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '1234';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE movies TO director;
```
**_Build and launch the app:_**

- run a *cmd* from the root directory of the application and enter the following command: ```mvnw package```
- after building the application, you need to run the jar-file created in the directory *target/* :
```java -jar target/films-library-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```

The app is running. 

Migration sql-scripts automatically populate the created movies database with the initial values. (Their physical location: *films-library/src/main/resources/db.migration)*
